# GroupProject_Customer_Accounts
Robert's TODO list for the accountOperations class

1)
add constructor to the class
the constructur will create a record file if one does not exist
<strong>done - Jem</strong> See most recent push - Robert

2)
write createRecord() 
the create record method will call all the setter methods and add the newly completed
struct to the record file
<strong>done - Jem</strong> See most recent push - Robert

3)
write displayAllRecords() 
this will display the entire record file <strong>done -Robert</strong>

4)
write getRecord()
displays a single record

5)
write deleteRecord()
to delete a customer record

6)
write  changeRecord()
to edit a current record

Tasks 5&6 will be dependent on getRecord() as this will be called first 

7) Split the input for First and Last name.  If you input these incorrectly, the errors put out make it incoherent.  Get and check for one thing at a time.
