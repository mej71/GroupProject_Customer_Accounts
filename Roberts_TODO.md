# GroupProject_Customer_Accounts
Robert's TODO list for the accountOperations class

1)
add constructor to the class
the constructur will create a record file if one does not exist

2)
write createRecord() 
the create record method will call all the setter methods and add the newly completed
struct to the record file

3)
write displayAllRecords() 
this will display the entire record file

4)
write getRecord()
displays a single record

5)
write deleteRecord()
to delete a customer record

6)
write  changeRecord()
to edit a current record

Tasks 5&6 will be dependent on getRecord() as this will be called first
